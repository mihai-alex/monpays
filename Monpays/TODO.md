! on it(Radu) !
invalidate sessions

Profile:
    after a remove, don't let anyone do anything with the profile

Users / Profiles:
    when an entity is removed, it's Audit's operation's TYPE should be 'REMOVE' instead of 'MODIFY'


Nice to have:
    specific mappers in which the repos and services are injected, not passed as parameters
    in the mapper find some conventions and use them
    versioning ?? XX when a user changes their password, all their sessions should be invalidated
